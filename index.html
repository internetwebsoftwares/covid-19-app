              <h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
                droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
                exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and
                quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by
                breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of
                someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface
                and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

              solution.
            </li>
            <li>Monitor temperature daily.</li>
            <li>Monitor oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter daily.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Hand hygiene: Hand hygiene must be ensured following contact with
