      Almost all States/UTs of the country are affected by COVID-19. Given the
      seasonal pattern of epidemic prone diseases observed every year in our
      country, it diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Seasonal Influenza,
      Leptospirosis, Chikungunya, Enteric fever, etc. can not only present as a
      diagnostic dilemma but may co-exist in COVID cases. This poses challenges
      in clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID , and have a bearing on
      clinical management and patient outcomes.
    </p>
    <h3>Clinical features</h3>
    <p>
      As per the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition, a COVID case
      may present with: 1) Acute onset of fever AND cough; OR 2) Acute onset of
      ANY THREE OR MORE of the following signs or symptoms: fever, cough,
      general weakness/fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza,
      dyspnoea, anorexia/nausea/ vomiting, diarrhoea, altered mental status.
      This case definition, although sensitive, is not very specific. Seasonal
      epidemic prone diseases, as cited in the foregoing paragraphs may all
      present as febrile illness, with symptoms that mimic COVID-19. If there is
      a co-infection, then apart from the febrile illness there may be
      constellation of signs and symptoms that may lead to difficulty in
      diagnosis
    </p>
    <h3>Approach to diagnosis of suspected co-infection</h3>
    <p>
        A high index of suspicion must be maintained for epidemic prone diseases (e.g. Dengue, Malaria,
Chikungunya, Seasonal influenza, Leptospirosis) prevalent in a particular geographic region during
monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Bacterial co-infections must also be suspected in moderate or
severe cases of COVID-19 not responding to treatment
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Malaria/Dengue:</b>It must be borne in mind that malaria/dengue can coexist with other infections,
and thus confirmation of malaria/dengue infection does not rule out the possibility of the patient
not suffering from COVID-19. Similarly, a high index of suspicion of malaria/dengue must be
there when a fever case is diagnosed as COVID-19, particularly during the rainy and post rainy
season in areas endemic for these diseases. </li>
        
        
            <li><b> Seasonal Influenza:</b>Both COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza present as Influenza Like Illness
(ILI)/SARI, hence all ILI/SARI cases in areas reporting COVID-19 cases must be evaluated and
tested for both COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza, if both viruses are circulating in population
under consideration. </li>
       
            <li><b>  Chikungunya:</b> Chikungunya presents with acute onset of moderate to high grade continuous
fever and malaise followed by rash, myalgia and arthralgia. Respiratory failure may ensue in late
stages. Co-infection with COVID-19 may be suspected in Chikungunya endemic areas, in the
months of monsoon. </li>
    
            <li><b> Leptospirosis:</b> Leptospirosis apart from it presenting as febrile illness, has also the tendency to
manifest as acute respiratory illness, leading to respiratory distress and shock. In areas where
Leptospirosis is known to cause outbreaks during monsoon/ post monsoon, the possibility of coinfection should be considered.  </li>
        
            <li><b> Scrub Typhus:</b> crub typhus is known to be prevalent in foothills of Himalayas viz Jammu &
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc. However, in recent
past, scrub typhus outbreaks have also been reported from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan,
Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The clinical picture consists of
sudden high-grade fever, severe headache, apathy, myalgia and generalized lymphadenopathy. A
maculopapular rash may appear first on the trunk and then on the extremities and blenches within
a few days. The patients may develop complications that include interstitial pneumonia (30 to
65% of cases), meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. Scrub typhus infection may co-exist with
COVID-19. </li>
<li><b> Bacterial infections:</b>
 Few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection. In
such cases, empiric antibiotic therapy as per local antibiogram needs to be considered
</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        While each of these infections are antigenically distinct with specific serological responses, yet in the
eventuality of co-infections, cross-reactions (resulting in false-positive /false negative results) cannot
be totally ruled out, especially if the testing kits used are not having requisite sensitivity and
specificity. Hence the tests recommended by ICMR (for COVID-19) and that recommended by the
concerned programme divisions (NVBDCP for vector borne diseases [Malaria, Dengue,
Chikungunya]) and NCDC (Seasonal Influenza, Leptospirosis, Scrub Typhus)] needs to be followed.
Availability of rapid diagnostic kits for malaria, dengue, scrub typhus should be ensured in such
COVID treatment facilities.
The table below summarizes the various (confirmatory) test to be undertaken for possible coinfections.
    </p>
    <h3>Case Management:</h3>
    <p>
Management of co-infection of COVID-19 with dengue, Influenza and bacterial co-infections may
however be challenging and are dealt with in greater detail here.
</p>
<h3>Early warning signs:</h3>
<p>If the patient is in a primary care setup, the following criteria should be monitored to assess patients 
clinical progress. Early warning signs for referral to higher centre are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
     Altered Mental Status (AVPU)
    </li>
    <li>
    Systolic blood pressure: &lt;90mmHg or &lt;20% of baseline in hypertensive patients
    </li>
    <li>
     Heart Rate/ Pulse Rate: &lt;50 or &gt;120 bpm
    </li>
    <li>
      SpO2: &lt;94 % on room air
    </li>
    <li>
      Respiratory Rate: &lt;10 or &gt;30 bpm
    </li>
    <li>
     Temperature: persistently >38ÂºC
    </li>
    <li>
     Urine Output: &lt;0.5 ml/Kg/Hr for consecutive 2 hrs
    </li>
    <li>
     Spontaneous bleeding/ haematuria
    </li>
    <li>
      Platelet count &lt;50.000/cumm
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<p>
    A concerted effort is required in prevention, surveillance, behaviour change communication and
management of such cases. Alert vigil, a high index of suspicion and constant awareness of the
possibility of co-infections can help physicians avert the adverse outcome of cases with coinfection
and improve clinical outcomes.
